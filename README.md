# The PHP Inferno

The PHP inferno is a guided set of exercises through PHP Hell. It is a cautionary tale about the features of PHP and how to use them safely. You will learn of the sins of the language and how to remain pious even in the darkest PHP codebases. The format is similar to the Ruby Koans, but has more long-form programming exercises, horrifying monsters and literary references. 

_PHP 5.4.9 and higher is required to begin._

## Getting started

* Clone the PHP Inferno to your local hellgate.
* PHP 5.4 can be installed via [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and tapping the [PHP homebrew Recipes](https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php).
* In BASH or any terminal that supports ANSI coloring, run:

		>	cd php-inferno/
		>	php descent.php

## A set of guided exercises through PHP Hell

**Limbo** -The beginning of your trip introduces you to basic PHP.

**Lust** - Arrays are PHP's most sensuous sinners.

**Gluttony** - Strings consume, regular expressions take all they can.

**Greed** - Classes want everything for themselves.

**Anger** - Callables in PHP can drive you into a rage.

**Heresy** - Type Juggling spits in the face of strong types.

**Violence** - Exceptions and errors in PHP brutally alter programs.

**Fraud** - PHP likes to misrepresent itself as entirely procedural, when that's not the case.

**Treachery** - The worst sins in the language, reserved for the lowest level of Hell.

Most of the circles end with a challenging exercise that will require everything you've learnt up until that point. It is worth noting that some prior programming experience will help you complete some of the more challenging questions.
